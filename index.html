      <p id="desc">Hello, I am currently a sophomore at Thomas Edison High School studying web development; this is my portfolio of all the projects I have worked on throughout the year. Every one of my works has greatly improved my understanding of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in different aspects. I am truly grateful for the skills that have been honed little by little through these projects. I hope you enjoy my portfolio! </p>
